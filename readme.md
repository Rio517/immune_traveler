# Immune Traveler

A work in progress to scrape CDC data and make it easy to identify needed vaccinations for multiple target countries (rather than having to do so by hand.)  This is a side project built as a means of playing with angular and working w/ newer, official elasticsearch-ruby gem, rather than old tire gem.
